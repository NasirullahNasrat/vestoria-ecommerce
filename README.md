*Please change the default password after your first login for security reasons.*

## üìö Learnings

Through the development of Vestoria, I gained significant experience in:

- Building RESTful APIs with Django REST Framework
- Implementing JWT authentication for secure user access
- Managing complex database relationships using Django's ORM
- Creating a responsive frontend with React, enhancing user experience
- Handling state management in React applications
- Developing comprehensive admin interfaces for content management

## üß© Challenges Faced

- **User Authentication:** Implementing secure JWT authentication was challenging initially, but I learned how to manage token-based authentication effectively
- **Handling Media Files:** Managing image uploads and storage required careful configuration to ensure that files were served correctly
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** Configuring CORS to allow communication between the frontend and backend was a learning curve
- **Admin Interface:** Creating an intuitive yet powerful admin panel required careful consideration of user workflows

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Django:** Web framework for building the backend
- **Django REST Framework:** For creating RESTful APIs
- **React Admin:** For the administration interface
- **Django Simple JWT:** For token-based authentication
- **React:** Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **CORS Headers:** To handle CORS issues
- **PostgreSQL:** You can change the Database from sqlite to PostgreSQL in settings.py
